# CoffeeMasters

## Overview
CoffeeMasters is a comprehensive mobile application developed as a final course project from ITMaster Coding Academy. It's built using Jetpack Compose and showcases a modern approach to Android app development. The app serves as an online platform for coffee enthusiasts, allowing users to browse and order their favorite coffee beverages.

## Features
- **My Order**: A user-friendly interface for placing coffee orders. This section includes functionality to detect duplicate items in the cart, updating quantities instead of adding new entries.
- **Order Form**: A form for users to enter their names when placing an order. The app stores the name persistently for future orders and clears the cart upon submission, displaying an order number in a Material SnackBar.
- **Info Section**: Contains an HTML-based interface with a fictional caf√© address and a feedback form. Users can leave reviews and rate their experience with a 1-5 star system. The form resets after submission, and a SnackBar message confirms the receipt of feedback.
- **Integration with Crashlytics**: The app includes Crashlytics integration for robust error logging and analysis.
- **Custom Launcher Icon**: Utilizes a custom icon from the assets to enhance the app's visual identity.

## Installation
Clone the repository and build the project using Android Studio or your preferred IDE. Ensure you have the latest version of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose installed.
